# BinaryClock
Code for a binary clock meant to run on SenseHat for RPI. Created by Matthew Dunn and Nathan Evans.

Requires:
  Python3
    SenseHat Library
    TKinter Library

Before running the code, make sure the SenseHat has been appropriately installed by sliding it onto the GPIO pins of the pi, and screwing it into place using the spacers and screws provided.

To run the program on Linux, go to the top level directory and run "python3 GUI.py".
